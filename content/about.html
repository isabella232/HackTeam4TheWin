<p>You are about to enter another dimension, a dimension not only of slick UI look and feel but of auto-updates and geo-location technology. A journey into a wondrous land of imagination. Next stop, the Telezone!</p>
<p>The Telezone solves a common problem among large companies with offices that span the entire globe. Take all of the guess work out of syncing up with remote co-workers. With one click you can easily view the current time for all of Telerik’s office locations. This will allow you to immediately figure out if your colleagues are just getting into the office, on their lunch break, or recharging their batteries for the next days work. </p>
<p>But the Telezone does not stop there. Much like Telerik’s mission statement, Telezone also delivers more than expected. One click and you are immediately transported to one of our 7 offices around the world. This map view is great for those employees who are visiting from a far way land. Not only does it allow you to navigate around the surrounding area with a quick scroll but you can also view recommended places to check out while you are in for a visit. These locations are added by local Telerik employees and they showcase some of their favorite watering holes and other entertainment venues. This app is perfect for a first time visit and even for the well versed traveler. </p>
